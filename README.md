# OpenGl - Com
This repository contains different Computer graphics algorithms implemented using OpenGL and C++.

To use them first you need to setup openGL in your system.

This repository have basic implmentations of openGl like triangle, circles in OpenGl and Animation using OpenGl.

This repository also have different computer graphics algorithms:

DDA line drawing algorithm,

Bresenham line drawing algorithm,

Circle drawing algorithm,

Ellipse drawing algorithm,

Flood fill algorithm,

Boundry fill algorithm,

Line Clipping Algorithms(Cohen-Sutherland algorithm & Liang Barsky algorithm),

2D Transformations(Translation,Scaling,Shearing,Reflection,Rotation),

Beizer-Curve,

Fractals.
