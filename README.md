# OpenGl
This repository contains different Computer graphics algorithms implemented.

To use them first u need to setup openGL in your system.

This repository have basic implmentations of openGl like triangle, circles in OpenGl and Animation using OpenGl.

This repository also have different computer graphics algorithms:

DDA line drawing algorithm,

Bresenham line drawing algorithm,

Circle drawing algorithm,

Ellipse drawing algorithm,

Flood fill algorithm,

Boundry fill algorithm,

Line Clipping Algorithms(Cohen-Sutherland,Liang Barsky),

2D Transformations(Translation,Scaling,Shearing,Reflection,Rotation),

Beizer Curve,

Fractals.
